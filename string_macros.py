═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    📋 DETECTED FOLDER & FILE TAGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FOLDER TAGS (detected in folder name, case-insensitive):
  • "optional"        → Folder has 24-33% chance to be included per run
  • "end"             → Folder becomes definitive loop endpoint (stops after)
  • "optional/end"    → Combination: optional folder that ends loop IF chosen
  • "time sensitive"  → No inefficient files generated (replaced with normal files)
                        Can be applied to:
                        - Main folder → ALL subfolders become time_sensitive
                        - Individual subfolders → Only that subfolder is time_sensitive
  • (Decimal support: "3.5" goes between folders 3 and 4)

FILE TAGS (detected in filename, case-insensitive):
  • "always first" or "alwaysfirst"  → File always plays first in its folder
  • "always last" or "alwayslast"    → File always plays last in its folder

SPECIAL FOLDER (exact name match, case-insensitive):
  • "Don't use features on me" → Files inserted unmodified (no features applied)
  • (Also accepts old name "dont mess with me" for backward compatibility)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    GROUP 1: PAUSE BREAKS (Anti-Detection Timing)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These features add natural pauses and delays to prevent robotic timing patterns.

1. WITHIN FILE PAUSES
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Inefficient & Normal files only)
   Old Name: "Intra-file pauses"
   What: Pauses between individual actions INSIDE files (except double-clicks)
   Source: From original macro recordings
   Duration: Varies (typically 2-3 min total per file)
   File Types: 
     - Raw: REMOVED (stripped out)
     - Inefficient: KEPT and multiplied
     - Normal: KEPT and multiplied
   Purpose: Natural hesitation between actions
   Code: Line ~850 (filter pauses in raw files)
   Manifest: "Within original files pauses: Xm Xs"

2. PRE-PLAY BUFFER
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always, all file types)
   Old Name: "Pre-file pauses"
   What: Fixed pause BEFORE each file starts playing
   Duration: 800ms (0.8 seconds) - FLAT, NO multiplier, NO randomization
   When: Applied BEFORE cursor movement (click release protection)
   Purpose: Ensures clicks from previous file are fully released
   Code: Line ~1376-1384 (pre_file_pause)
   Total Impact: ~2m 40s per 50-minute output (200 files × 800ms)
   Manifest: "PRE-Play Buffer: Xm Xs"
   Order: PRE-pause → Cursor transition → File plays

3. INEFFICIENT BEFORE FILE PAUSE
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Inefficient files ONLY, file >= 25 seconds)
   Old Name: "Before File Pause" or "Inter-file pauses" or "Between cycles pause"
   What: Longer pause between complete action cycles
   Duration: 10-30 seconds (10000-30000ms, random, NOT rounded, NO multiplier)
   File Length Check: Only applied if file duration >= 25 seconds
   File Types:
     - Raw: ❌ DISABLED
     - Inefficient: ✅ ACTIVE (if file >= 25s)
     - Normal: ❌ DISABLED
   Purpose: Major break between action sequences
   Code: Line ~2084-2093 (inter_cycle_pause with file length check)
   Manifest: "INEFFICIENT Before File Pause: Xm Xs"

4. POST-PAUSE DELAYS
   Status: ⚠️ DISABLED (Marked for future removal)
   Old Name: "Post-pause delays"
   What: Delay after pre-pause, before cursor moves
   Duration: 500-1000ms × multiplier (when active)
   Reason Disabled: Redundant with PRE-PLAY BUFFER
   Code: Line ~1135-1140 (currently disabled)
   Future: Will be removed in v4.0
   Manifest: Shows 0m 0s when disabled

5. INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Inefficient files ONLY)
   Old Name: "Massive pause"
   What: One random pause inserted at safe location
   Duration: 2-5 minutes (120000-300000ms, random, NOT rounded) × multiplier
   Examples: ×2.0 = 4-10 min | ×3.0 = 6-15 min
   Safe Location Detection: EXCLUDES pause from:
     - Drag sequences (between DragStart and DragEnd)
     - Rapid click sequences (double-clicks, spam clicks)
     - First/last 10% of file (for safety)
     - Immediately BEFORE DragStart events (FIX v3.15.2)
   Where: Random safe point in middle 80% of file
   File Types:
     - Raw: ❌ NOT USED
     - Inefficient: ✅ INSERTED
     - Normal: ❌ NOT USED
   Purpose: Simulates AFK/distracted behavior
   Code: Line ~1171-1220 (insert_massive_pause with drag protection)
   Manifest: "INEFFICIENT MASSIVE PAUSE: Xm Xs"
   
   BUG FIX (v3.15.2): Added check to prevent pause insertion immediately before
   DragStart events. Previously, pauses could be inserted right before DragStart,
   which shifted the DragEnd forward in time, making clicks appear to last 1-4
   seconds instead of <150ms, causing drag/clamp issues.

6. MULTIPLIER SYSTEM
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Scales all pause durations by multiplier value
   Values by File Type (UPDATED v3.13.0):
     Raw Files:
       • x1.0 (50% probability)
       • x1.1 (50% probability)
     
     Normal Files:
       • x1.3 (65% probability)
       • x1.5 (35% probability)
     
     Inefficient Files:
       • x2.0 (60% probability)
       • x3.0 (40% probability)
   
   Purpose: Varied timing patterns across output files
   Code: Line ~1918-1927 (multiplier selection)
   Manifest: "(xN Multiplier)" shown in each file header

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
              GROUP 2: PATTERN BREAKING (Anti-Detection Variance)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These features add variation and unpredictability to prevent detectable patterns.

1. CURSOR TO START POINT
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   Old Name: "Cursor transitions"
   What: Smooth cursor movement from file end position to next file start
   Duration: 200-400ms per transition (varies by path style)
   Path Styles (random per transition):
     • Efficient: Direct path, few curves, faster
     • Swift: Very fast, straight line
     • Meandering: Curved path, more wandering
     • Hesitant: Slow start, acceleration, deceleration
   Speed Variations: Very fast (100-200ms) to Very slow (700-1000ms)
   Purpose: No mouse teleportation; realistic cursor flow with variety
   Code: Line ~498-576 (generate_human_path with path styles)
   Impact: Adds ~30-35s to 50-minute output
   Manifest: "CURSOR to Start Point: Xm Xs"
   Note: This DOES add time to total duration (intentional)

2. IDLE CURSOR WANDERING
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always, during pauses > 1s)
   Old Name: "Idle mouse movements"
   What: Small random mouse wiggles during long pauses
   When: Any pause > 1 second
   Pattern: Smooth Bézier curves, realistic speed
   Purpose: Cursor doesn't stay frozen during waits
   Code: Line ~702-793 (add_idle_movements)
   Impact: ~7-11 minutes "movement time" per 50-min output
   Manifest: "Idle Mouse Movements: Xm Xs"
   Note: This does NOT extend file duration (happens during existing pauses)

3. MOUSE JITTER
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (9-21% of movements, with exclusions)
   What: Random small offsets to cursor positions
   Percentage: 9-21% of all mouse movements get jittered
   Amount: Small random offset per movement
   Exclusion Zones (NO JITTER):
     • 1000ms before/after any click
     • 1500ms for rapid click sequences (3+ clicks in 1500ms)
     • During drag operations (hold + move + release)
   Purpose: Natural hand tremor, but maintains click accuracy
   Code: Line ~669-677 (apply_smart_jitter)
   Protection: Line ~552-589 (detect rapid clicks)
   Note: DISABLED near clicks to prevent off-target clicks
   Manifest: "Mouse Jitter: XX%"

4. RANDOM FILE QUEUE
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Files selected randomly from each folder per cycle
   Method: Random choice from available files
   Avoids: Repeating same folder combination (via history)
   Purpose: No predictable file order
   Code: Line ~1475 (rng.choice for file selection)
   Manifest: File order visible in manifest list

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
            GROUP 3: ENSURING SMOOTH OPERATION (Reliability)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These features ensure files play correctly without breaking or causing errors.

1. RAPID CLICK PROTECTION
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Detects rapid click sequences and extends jitter exclusion zones
   Detection: 3+ clicks within 1500ms
   Protection: Extends exclusion from 1000ms → 1500ms
   Purpose: Prevents jitter from breaking rapid action sequences
   Code: Line ~552-589 (detect_rapid_click_sequences)

2. DRAG OPERATION PROTECTION
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Detects drag operations and prevents jitter during them
   Detection: Hold + Move + Release patterns
   Protection: NO jitter during entire drag sequence
   Purpose: Maintains drag accuracy
   Code: Line ~596-628 (detect_drag_operations)

3. EVENT TIMING INTEGRITY PROTECTION
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always, all time-adding features)
   What: Prevents pauses/modifications from interfering with drag/click timing
   Protection Zones (NO time modification):
     • Between DragStart and DragEnd pairs
     • Immediately BEFORE DragStart events
     • Within rapid click sequences
     • First/last 10% of file
   Impact: Maintains click responsiveness (<200ms), prevents drag/clamp issues
   Purpose: CRITICAL protection to prevent clicks being held 1-4 seconds
   Code: Line ~1171-1220 (insert_massive_pause with protection)
   Added: v3.15.2 (bug fix for click timing)

4. COMBINATION HISTORY
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Tracks which folder combinations have been used
   Prevents: Repeating same combination across cycles
   Tracking: "F1=file01.json|F2=file05.json|F3=file12.json"
   File: COMBINATION_HISTORY_XX.txt (created per bundle)
   Purpose: Maximum variety across runs
   Code: Line ~1380-1510 (ManualHistoryTracker class)

5. MANUAL HISTORY UPLOAD
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If files present)
   What: Upload old combination files to avoid repeating them
   Location: input_macros/combination_history/
   Reads: All .txt files automatically
   Purpose: Never repeat across multiple runs/sessions
   Code: Line ~1410-1450 (load history from folder)

6. ALPHABETICAL NAMING
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
   What: Organized naming convention for output files
   Pattern:
     Raw files:        ^XX_A, ^XX_B, ^XX_C
     Inefficient:      ¬¬XX_D, ¬¬XX_E, ¬¬XX_F
     Normal:           XX_G, XX_H, XX_I, XX_J, XX_K, XX_L
   Purpose: Easy identification of file type at a glance
   Code: Line ~1940-1980 (filename generation)

7. FOLDER-NUMBER BASED STRUCTURE
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always, supports decimals)
   Old Name: "Folder-based structure"
   What: Folders numbered in sequence; files cycle through them
   Format: "1- action/", "2- bank/", "3.5- optional/", "4- continue/"
   Decimal Support: 3.5 goes after 3 and before 4
   Pattern: F1 → F2 → F3 → F3.5 → F4 → F1 → ...
   Purpose: Maintains sequential action steps
   Code: Line ~1318-1360 (folder number extraction & sorting)

8. 'OPTIONAL' TAGGED FOLDERS
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If "optional" in folder name)
   Old Name: "Optional folders"
   Tag Detection: "optional" anywhere in folder name (case-insensitive)
   Behavior: Folder has random chance to be included in each cycle
   Chance: 24-33% (randomized per bundle, consistent within bundle)
   Example: "3 optional- bank early/"
   Purpose: Unpredictable action path variations
   Code: Line ~1442 (is_optional detection)

9. 'END' TAGGED FOLDERS
   Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If "end" in folder name)
   Tag Detection: "end" anywhere in folder name (case-insensitive)
   Behavior: Folder becomes definitive loop endpoint (stops after)
   Example: "5 end- logout/"
   Purpose: Controlled endpoint timing
   Code: Line ~1347 (is_end detection)

10. 'OPTIONAL/END' COMBO TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If both "optional" and "end" in name)
    Tag Detection: Both "optional" AND "end" in folder name
    Behavior: 
      - 24-33% chance to include folder
      - IF included: Loop stops at this folder
      - IF skipped: Loop continues to next folders
    Example: "3.5 optional/end- early bank/"
    Purpose: Sometimes end early, sometimes continue full loop
    Code: Line ~1448-1462 (is_optional_end handling)

11. 'TIME SENSITIVE' TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If "time sensitive" in folder name)
    New Feature: v3.13.0 | Enhanced: v3.14.2
    Tag Detection: "time sensitive" anywhere in folder name (case-insensitive)
    Behavior: NO inefficient files generated
    
    Two Application Modes:
      A) MAIN FOLDER TAGGED:
         Example: "61- Mining TIME SENSITIVE/"
                    └── 1- setup/
                    └── 2- mine/
                    └── 3- bank/
         Result: ALL subfolders (1, 2, 3) become time_sensitive
         
      B) INDIVIDUAL SUBFOLDER TAGGED:
         Example: "61- Mining/"
                    └── 1- setup/
                    └── 2 time sensitive- mine/  ← Only this one
                    └── 3- bank/
         Result: Only subfolder 2 is time_sensitive
    
    File Distribution Changes:
      - Regular folder: 3 Raw + 3 Inef + 6 Normal = 12 files
      - Time sensitive: 3 Raw + 0 Inef + 9 Normal = 12 files
    
    Priority: Main folder tag overrides individual subfolder tags
    Purpose: Activities requiring consistent timing (combat, PvP, timed tasks)
    Code: Line ~1449-1459 (main folder check), Line ~1505-1511 (subfolder check)
    Note: Entire bundle affected if ANY folder is time_sensitive

12. 'DON'T USE FEATURES ON ME' TAGGED FOLDERS
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If folder name matches)
    Old Name: "DMWM Support" or "dont mess with me"
    Tag Detection: Exact match "Don't use features on me" (case-insensitive)
    Backward Compatible: Also accepts old name "dont mess with me"
    Behavior: Files from this folder inserted completely unmodified
    Features Skipped: NO jitter, NO pauses, NO modifications
    Marked In Manifest: "[UNMODIFIED] filename.json"
    Purpose: Include specific pre-made sequences as-is
    Code: Line ~1433-1441 (folder detection)

13. ALWAYS FIRST/LAST FILES
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (If tagged in filename)
    Tag Detection: "always first", "alwaysfirst", "always last", "alwayslast"
    Location: In filename (case-insensitive)
    Behavior:
      - "always first" → Plays first in its folder (before random selection)
      - "always last" → Plays last in its folder (after random selection)
    Example: "setup_always_first.json", "cleanup_alwayslast.json"
    Purpose: Guaranteed sequence control within folders
    Code: Line ~1333-1340 (always_first/last detection)

14. COMPREHENSIVE MANIFEST
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
    What: Detailed breakdown showing all timing and features
    Location: __MANIFEST_XX__.txt in output folder
    Shows:
      - All file types and durations
      - Complete pause breakdown by type
      - File list with cumulative timeline
      - Multiplier and jitter percentage
      - Folder structure
    Purpose: Complete transparency and verification
    Code: Line ~1965-2045 (manifest generation)

15. SPECIFIC FOLDERS FILTERING
    Status: ⚙️ OPTIONAL (--specific-folders <file>)
    What: Only process folders listed in file
    Default: Process ALL numbered folders
    Usage: Pass text file with folder numbers (one per line)
    Purpose: Run subset of activities
    Code: Line ~1640-1665 (filtering logic)

16. CHAT INSERTS
    Status: ⚙️ OPTIONAL (Disabled by default, --no-chat flag)
    What: Random chat messages inserted in files
    Frequency: 50% of files when enabled
    Default: DISABLED in workflows
    Purpose: Social presence simulation
    Code: Line ~1850-1860 (chat insertion - currently bypassed)

17. PRE-PLAY BUFFER GUARANTEE (files_added counter)
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
    Added: v3.17.2
    What: Guarantees the pre-play buffer (300ms) fires before EVERY file transition,
          including always_first and always_last files.
    Problem It Solved:
      - The original guard was "if cycle_events:" — checking if the events list was
        non-empty to decide whether to insert the buffer.
      - Python's nonlocal binding means if the outer scope ever rebinds cycle_events
        (e.g. cycle_events = []) after the inner function captures it, the inner
        function's nonlocal lookup sees the old empty reference.
      - Result: always_first / always_last files started at 0ms after the previous
        file ended — no buffer, no cursor path. Last click of previous file and first
        click of next file fired on the same millisecond, causing missed actions.
    Fix: Replaced "if cycle_events:" with "if files_added > 0:" using an explicit
         integer counter. Integers cannot be silently rebound the same way as lists.
         Counter is declared in outer scope, accessed via nonlocal, incremented by 1
         after every successful file add.
    Also Fixed: Cursor path condition was "if last_x and first_x" — this silently
                fails when X=0 (a valid screen coordinate, evaluates as falsy in Python).
                Changed to "if last_x is not None and first_x is not None".
    Impact: All file transitions now guaranteed to have:
              File ends → 500-800ms buffer (random) → cursor path → next file starts
    Code: add_file_to_cycle() inner function; files_added init in string_cycle()

18. FAIL-FAST ERROR HANDLING
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always)
    Added: v3.17.1
    What: All fatal early-exit conditions now call sys.exit(1) instead of return.
    Problem It Solved:
      - "return" in main() exits with code 0 (success). GitHub Actions saw the Python
        step succeed, continued to the ZIP step, and failed there with a confusing
        "empty directory" error — hiding the real cause.
      - Made debugging very slow: error appeared in the wrong step entirely.
    Conditions Now Covered:
      • Input root folder not found → exits, prints the path it searched
      • No numbered subfolders found → exits, prints directory contents
      • Specific folders file missing or unreadable → exits with reason
      • None of the specified folder names matched → exits, prints what it looked
        for vs what was actually available (most common cause: name mismatch)
    Result: Workflow fails at the Python step with the exact reason visible in logs.
    Code: main() — four sys.exit(1) calls replacing return statements

19. FLAT FOLDER SUPPORT
    Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Always, auto-detected)
    Added: v3.18.4
    What: Allows a main folder to contain JSON files directly with no numbered
          subfolders. The script detects this automatically and treats all files
          in the folder as a single pool (virtual subfolder 1.0).
    Structure Supported:
      NORMAL (numbered subfolders):        FLAT (files directly inside):
      20- Smth R2H/                        20- Smth R2H/
        1- action/                           file_a.json
          file.json                          file_b.json
        2- bank/                             always first.json
          file.json
    Behaviour:
      - Files are randomly selected from the pool each cycle (same as a regular
        numbered subfolder)
      - always_first / always_last tags in filenames still work
      - time_sensitive main folder tag still works
      - logout files are excluded from the pool automatically
      - Combination history tracks normally
    Detection: Triggered when zero numbered subfolders are found but JSON files
               exist directly in the folder
    Code: scan_for_numbered_subfolders() — flat folder block at end of function
